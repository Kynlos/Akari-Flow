# GitHub Pages Update Summary

**Changes Made:** 6

### send-notifications.ts -> api/send-notifications.md
- **Action:** CREATE
- **Reasoning:** The send-notifications script is a distinct notification service not covered by existing pages, requiring its own documentation page.

### send-notifications.ts -> features/notification-system.md
- **Action:** APPEND
- **Reasoning:** The send-notifications script extends the existing notification system feature, so it should be added to that page rather than creating a new one.

### send-notifications.ts -> modules/notification-system.md
- **Action:** APPEND
- **Reasoning:** The send-notifications script extends the existing notification system; it fits naturally as an additional section in the Notification System documentation rather than creating a separate page.
